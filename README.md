# Generation of Image Annotations with Deep Learning 
This project in deep learning involves developing a model that can generate descriptions/captions of images.

The architecture of the Deep Neural Net is as follows:
 - Deep CNN Encoder: InceptionV3
 - LSTM base Decoder: LSTM layers are used for decoding
